# deterministic LFH

Windows have done a lot of work on the NT heap internals, replacing the super-old Windows XP lookaside with the LFH (Low Fragmentation Heap, the current front end). I'm not going to talk about the LFH internals, since I assume it's trivial knowledge (we all love to exploit corruptions on the LFH, or in the Page/NonPagePoolNx in the kernel). Also, there are simply *excellent* papers and works describing it in very nice ways. I personally feel I owe a lot to Chris Valasek:

[Understanding the LFH](http://illmatics.com/Understanding_the_LFH.pdf)

[Windows 8 Heap Internals](https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-12/Briefings/Valasek/BH_US_12_Valasek_Windows_8_Heap_Internals_Slides.pdf)

[Windows 10 Segment Heap](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Yason-Windows-10-Segment-Heap-Internals.pdf)

So what do I want to do here? I'm going to present a known issue in the randomization of the LFH in Windows 8+. The randomization, as you all know, came up as mitigation against trivial exploit techniques of UAF or different kinds of corruption vulnerabilities. In those cases, we usually want to shape our heap to get contiguous allocations, or to be able to make the stub malloc() --> free() --> malloc() return the same chunk. So, shaping the heap to be something like that:

![alt text](https://github.com/saaramar/Deterministic_LFH/raw/master/images/trivial_heap_shape.png "")

is not quite trivial now, since allocations in the LFH are randomized by order. Of-course, a lot of different attacks can be performed (spray the whole userblocks with some desired object, and then corrupt all of them, and a lot more - there is always a way to execute code!), but let's attack the randomization itself here.

The following issue is *NOT* news - it has been known for a long time by now, and I have seen it in many posts and exploits. I just saw a lot of unknown and unware posts and people regarding this, so I thought - why not write trivial POC and a little explanation about it?

New commit: Matt Miller pointed out that this primitive is broken in Windows 10 new build (16179). I was curious, and bindiffed it, reversed the new ntdll and found why. After I present the attack, I'll explain why it no longer holds on build 16179.

## Randomization Implementation

The implementation is really simple. We can find it in the ntdll!RtlpCreateLowFragHeap function (again, I assume you all know the mechanism in ntdll, and you can find a great internals description in the published posts and exploits). There is a call to RtlpInitializeLfhRandomDataArray:

![alt text](https://github.com/saaramar/Deterministic_LFH/raw/master/images/RtlpInitializeLfhRandomDataArray.png "")

RtlpInitializeLfhRandomDataArray will fill the RtlpLowFragHeapRandomData array with 0x100 random values. This random array will then be used with some other value which together are used to determine some position value. From this position, we look for the first free chunk in the relevant userblocks to return to the user. You can see it all in the initialization of the SubSegment in ntdll!RtlpSubSegmentInitialize. Really simple, right?

## Nice attack

So, trivially, if we'll try to do something like this:

![alt text](https://github.com/saaramar/Deterministic_LFH/raw/master/images/check_freed.png "")

we'll get different chunks. But, we could do something like this:

![alt text](https://github.com/saaramar/Deterministic_LFH/raw/master/images/getFreedChunk.png "")

The last malloc will start to search for a free chunk in the bitmap, from the same position it started in the first malloc! So we'll get the same chunk! The *exact* same trick can be used to shape the heap and get contiguous chunks:

![alt text](https://github.com/saaramar/Deterministic_LFH/raw/master/images/getContiguousAllocations.png "")

chunk1 and chunk2 will be adjcent to each other. Cool!

You can see the trivial POCs in the source. Enjoy.

## Windows 10 build 16179

Well, if we just execute my POC on Windows 10 build 16179, we'll see that something breaks.

![alt text](https://github.com/saaramar/Deterministic_LFH/raw/master/images/example_16179.png "")

Interesting! Let's see why. I bindiff ntdll, and found pretty quickly that there was no change to the random data array itself (there are no additional writes to RtlpLowFragHeapRandomData), and it remains with the same values for the entire heap lifetime. I actually expected from Microsoft to change that - I mean, you want random? Why not use a *truly* random all the time?

But fine, let's keep looking. Pretty quickly you see that the diff is in the logic of picking a new value from the random data array. The index we are looking for, as I explained before, is just increment by 1 and overlapped on 0x100. Well, in build 16179, this was patched. Now, they add another call to RtlpHeapGenerateRandomValue32(), and with that they change the next index!

code from build 16179:

I debugged both of them. You can see the full tracing in the debug_trace directory. I cut one change of the slot and pasted it here.

## Uniform Distribution

One important note here, is that we don’t want to pointer to the random data array (ntdll!RtlpLowFragHeapRandomData) to simply overlapped from 0xff to random index between [0x0, 0xff]. Such behavior would mean that the probability we used the values in the beginning of the random data array is much smaller than the probability we used end of the array (the probability we used RtlpLowFragHeapRandomData[0xff] is 1).

So, in order to avoid such a case, the index the code picks from is reset to a random index not at 0xff, but only when the MSB and LSB of the current index are equal (see the branch screenshot above). And it means that we actually have uniform distribution over the entire range [0, 0xff]

For instance, those [traces](https://github.com/saaramar/Deterministic_LFH/raw/master/debug_traces/build_17763_traces.txt) are from build 17763:

But that’s not all. The content of the ```RtlpLowFragHeapRandomData``` array actually keeps changing over time. If we look at all the xrefs of this symbol, we see 3 places in ntdll:

The first one is clear – it is the first loop we saw at the beginning of this blogpost, the first time we initialize the array to contain truly random values. However, there is another improvement – each time a new subsegment is being initialized, we update 8 bytes of  ```RtlpLowFragHeapRandomData```, as can be shown here:
